In the mining industry, the general issue of airborne dust poses significant risks to the health
 and safety of mine workers. The lack of a comprehensive and real-time dust measurement system
 tailored for mining environments hinders the ability to proactively address and mitigate these risks. 
Existing solutions often fall short in accuracy, immediacy, and adaptability to the unique conditions
 of mining operations, leading to suboptimal occupational health outcomes. To bridge this gap, 
there is a critical need for the development of an advanced dust measurement system that can provide accurate, 
real-time data, enabling timely decision-making and fostering a safer working environment for mine personnel.
